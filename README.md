# TCP Chatroom 

## Overview

This chat app allows you to create a chatroom in your cli and send messages to users. 

## How to use 

* Clone down this repo.
* In your console run `node server.js` to get your server started.
* In a separate console run `node client.js` to connect to the chatroom as a new user.
* Once in the chatroom you can run: 
    1. `@all` command to send a message to the entire chatroom.
    2. `@nick:<new username>` to change your username.
    3. `@dm:<another user>` to direct message that user. 

There you go! Now you can chat to yourself through endless command lines!
